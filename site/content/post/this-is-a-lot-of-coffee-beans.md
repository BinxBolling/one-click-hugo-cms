This picture is of a ton of coffee beans. Is it Folger's or picked by macaques born on a new moon. This could get long considering how much I'm thinking about this multitudinous mound of coffee. 

Does it get longer? Oh you bet your ass, it does. It keeps on going that we may need to hit some Lorem Ipsum pretty damn soon. Either that or something else.
